# Repository for Android mobile apps.

This repository hosts an Android app for mobile casual games. The app was created using various AI tools such as ChatGPT and Windsurf. For the app I used Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and the MVVM design pattern.

In addition, I also did some manual tweaking of the UI.
