# Casual Games.

Create an app for hosting casual games

### Setup Command

1. Create a multipage-page Android app using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and the MVVM design pattern. Use stateless composables. Create a master page for hosting all other pages. The bottom of this page will include a navigation bar. All pages will be hosted here.
1. Implement the sudoku game in its own custom page. Add this to a custom folder designed for storing multiple game pages

In sudoku, the 9 by 9 grid of numbers is sub-divided into a 3 by 3 grid by heavier lines. Please add these lines. Also, surround the entire grid with a square of same heavier thickness.
Change the background of a sudoku cell to light blue while it is selected. Also add a button to start a new game and a button to restart the existing game in sudoku
Add a back button to take players back to the games page
Center buttons used to enter guess numbers in the sudoku game
When a user clicks a sudoku square, highlight the row it is on, the column, and the sub-grid the number it belongs to. Use light grey as a background highlight color
